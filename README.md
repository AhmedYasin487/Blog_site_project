-I can user just want to right and don't want to publish than he can just save his blog which can automatically save in draft.
-He can publish that blog from his draft 
-After publishing stories will shown on the home page
-People can also add comments on our blogs and blog author will have authority to approve or disapprove the comment. If he approve then that will show in below your blog otherwise that will just deleted

Well you can learn the use of templates if you are beginner cause This is my first functional webiste.
You can check how I make models.
You can check how I add urls or paths.
This is very basic and easily do able project but it means a lot cause it is so productive. I will learn a lot.
